# Hungry Penguin

Press **space** to start game and use **left** and **right** arrows to move the penguin.

The goal of this game is to eat as many fish as possible without it fall out of the screen, and avoid touching any eggs.

When playing, you will see score and level. Score increases by one every time you eat a fish. Level increases the speed of the fish. It increases every 5 fish you've eaten.
There is also a sound button at top right corner of the screen. You can choose to have the sound on or off of your choice.

The game is over if you missed a fish and touched an egg. Click on screen to restart when game is over.

**Have FUN!**
